## Wasting time

The new PC definitely improved the speed of my daily work.<br/>
Something else I did was installing a JVM that supports advanced Hotreload (methods removal, signature changes etc.), thanks to [Jorel's guide](https://blog.jorel.dev/posts/Hotswappable-Spigot-Plugins/).<br/>
Sadly, this advanced Hotreload doesn't work well in some cases, for example [Spigot Inventory new changes](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/inventoryview-changed-to-interface-backwards-compatibility.651754/#post-4743652).

### Discord vs Forum

During these 2 years of testing, it's clear that people don't like using websites and prefer the instant messaging capabilities of Discord, even if the platform is not great.<br/>
Due to this, I decided to move away from the forum and revamp the Discord to accommodate the request of the community. This seems to already be working better, as the members are more active than before on the forum.

##### Invalid support requests

Invalid support requests are still an issue, let's hope the Discord community improvements will lower down invalid requests.
31% ([1239](https://github.com/PluginBugs/Issues-ItemsAdder/issues?q=label%3A%22verdict%3A+invalid%22%2C%22verdict%3A+can%27t+reproduce%22%2C%22outdated%3A+server%22%2C%22outdated%3A+dependency%22%2C%22outdated%3A+plugin%22%2C%22outdated%3A+client%22%2C%22status%3A+need+more+info%22%2C%22verdict%3A+can%27t+reproduce%22%2C%22verdict%3A+misconfigured%22+)/3956) of the GitHub issues pages of **ItemsAdder** are invalid (data obtained on 2024-Oct-24).<br />

I decided to close invalid requests providing the least amount of info to the customer. This allows me to waste less time.

### License checking

The revamp of the Discord community gave me the opportunity to work on a new verification bot that made license verification easy for both me and the customer. I setup various channels that can be accessed only by who verified their purchase.<br/>
It's now very easy to identify who have the rights to ask for help and who is just curious or is using an unofficially obtained JAR.

### Lack of staff members

I finally have found new people who help me to manage basic support requests and help me to handle the Discord community.<br/>
I also plan to automate answering with some sort of AI that is trained on my docs and the community messages.

### Beta testing team lack of response

Beta testing is now open to everyone who owns the licenses, thanks to the new license verification system I can now easily give beta testing automatically to only who owns the product.

## Conclusion

Wishing everyone a great end of the year in 2024, and thank you for being a part of my community.
