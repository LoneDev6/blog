## Minecraft is slow


:::info
**Minecraft** is known to be very heavy, the community had fixed most of its problems.<br />

### 1. Downloading Fabric

First you have to [download](https://fabricmc.net/use/) **Fabric** and install it.<br />
Click on the "**Download installer**" button:

Open the zip and extract the folders `mods` and `config` inside your `.minecraft` folder (or inside the **Fabric** profile folder).
