        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2><p>I&#x27;ve always felt the need to backup my PC automatically without worrying about it.<br/>
I also wanted to find a way to restore my PC disks without too much work in case one of them failed someday.<br/></p><p>I searched a lot online for a proper solution for this but I couldn&#x27;t find anything which was <strong>plug &amp; play</strong> (&amp; forget).</p><h2>My solution</h2><p>I bought a Synology NAS which supports <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/active_backup_business">Active Backup for Business</a>.<br/>
The only limitation is that this backup system lacks of a feature to get the PC turned on automatically before backup and turned off after backup, so I had to make an hack.</p><p>:::warning
This tutorial was tested on <a href="https://www.synology.com/it-it/products/DS220+">DS220+</a> and on a PC with <strong>Windows 10</strong>.
:::</p><h3>1. Setting up the Active Backup for Business app</h3><p>First of all you have to download it from the <strong>Package Center</strong>.<br/></p><p><img src="imgs/1.png"/></p><p>Then you can access it through the apps menu.</p><p><img src="imgs/2.png"/></p><p>Now add a new device, in this case your PC.</p><p><img src="imgs/3.png"/></p><p>Create a backup task for the Windows disk selecting <code>System volume</code> as type.</p><p><img src="imgs/4.png"/></p><p>Schedule it to be ran at 3.20AM each Monday.</p><p><img src="imgs/4_2.png"/></p><p>Create a backup task for your other disks selecting <code>Customized volume</code> as type.</p><p><img src="imgs/5.png"/></p><p>Schedule them/it to be ran at 3.20AM each Monday.</p><p><img src="imgs/4_2.png"/></p><h3>2. Setting up the Active Backup for Business Agent on Windows</h3><p>You also have to download the <a href="https://kb.synology.com/DSM/help/ActiveBackupBusinessAgent/activebackupbusinessagent">Agent app for Windows</a>, follow their installation tutorial.</p><h3>3. Scheduling automatic startup/shutdown of your Synology</h3><p>Open the <code>Control panel</code>, then open <code>Hardware &amp; Power</code>.<br/>
Now create a new <code>Startup</code> task and set it to be executed at 3AM. We want to make sure the Synology NAS is turned on completely before backups.<br/>
Create a new <code>Shut Down</code> task and set it to be executed at 7AM. We want make sure all backups are finished and let the NAS do its own things if needed (optimizing the drive, deleting old backups etc).</p><p><img src="imgs/6.png"/></p><h3>4. Scheduling automatic startup of your PC</h3><p>Open the <code>Control panel</code>, then open <code>Task Scheduler</code>.<br/>
Now create a new task and set it to be executed at 3.10AM, we want to make sure the Synology NAS is turned on completely before turning on our PC or it can&#x27;t launch the command to turn on the PC.</p><p><img src="imgs/7.png"/>
<img src="imgs/8.png"/></p><p>Now set the <code>User-defined script</code> to this command which will send a packet to the PC to turn it on.<br/>
<code>synonet --wake 00:00:00:00:00:00 eth0;</code><br/>
Instead of <code>00:00:00:00:00:00</code> you have to set your own PC mac address (search online how to get it).<br/>
You can also set a notification email to know when the PC was turned on to create a backup.<br/></p><p><img src="imgs/9.png"/></p><p>:::warning
Make sure to enable WakeOnLan on your motherboard, search online on how to do that (method changes on every PC).<br/>
:::</p><h3>5. Scheduling automatic shutdown of your PC</h3><p>You have to use my own program in order to schedule an automatic shutdown of your PC after every backup is finished since <strong>Active Backup for Business</strong> Agent lacks of this feature. <br/>
Download my program from my <a href="https://github.com/LoneDev6/ActiveBackupShutdown">Github repo</a> and schedule an automated task to run it on Windows startup.</p><h3>6. Done!</h3><p>I know this tutorial may not be really for beginners but I&#x27;d prefer to avoid spoonfeeding people.<br/>
Good luck with your backups!</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2021-12-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ItemsAdder]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>ItemsAdder</h2><p><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/73355/">ItemsAdder</a> is my most successful product. It&#x27;s a plugin for <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/">Spigot</a> servers which allows admins to extend the game without modding the client.</p><h2>First days</h2><p>The plugin was published initially on 2016 and was called <strong>NewItems</strong>, it was one of my very first Java projects and I was a newbie on Spigot development.<br/>
I abandoned the old project after a year or so due to personal life, but then I picked it back up and started working on the very new version which ended up begin renamed ItemsAdder. As you know this version has more features, has a totally different structure and allows to achieve extreme customization of the game.</p><h2>Current days</h2><p>I didn&#x27;t expect this much fame for that single product, the <a href="https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/ItemsAdder/7023">max peak</a> of servers which use ItemsAdder amounts to <strong>1097 max online servers</strong> and <strong>3800 max players</strong> enjoying the plugin.<br/>
ItemsAdder is in the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/m3edZ8T.png">top 3</a> of the best voted paid Spigot plugins to this date, which is unbelievable, a plugin published in 2019 managed to reach the top 3 in 2 years while the forum itself is online since 2012.</p><p>Currently my main efforts are to maintain the most stable and optimized code as possible because this plugin is used on servers with more than 100 players connected, performance is a priority in these cases.</p><p>The most difficult task is to give support to customers because a lot of them find it easier to contact me without reading the official tutorials nor asking to the other community members and this sadly cuts a lot of the development time.
I&#x27;d love to spend more time on actually coding the plugin.<br/>
Sadly most of them blackmail me with 1 star reviews which is making this situation really hard to maintain in the long term. </p><h2>The future</h2><p>Back in the day I rushed a lot of ItemsAdder features initial planning, this resulted in non-balanced default stats and gameplay, this is why I&#x27;m currently working with some friends to rebalance the default items pack and provide a better gameplay.<br/>
This is a very long task due to the fact that this plugin offers more than 500 default items/materials/blocks but I&#x27;ll do my best to release an updated pack before mid 2022.<br/>
I also plan to hook into the Minecraft gameplay itself and fix all the unbalanced features of the vanilla gameplay. Sadly this game has a lot of flaws which allow users to <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/mc/run/zq13899m">speedrun it in no time</a>.</p><p>One of the last important tasks I have scheduled is to find a proper way to avoid spamming customers which are contacting me everyday to ask basic questions. Right now I have no solution as this is the problem every developer has with this community.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Minecraft is slow</h2><p>:::info
<strong>Minecraft</strong> is known to be very heavy, the community had fixed most of its problems.<br/>
My plugins don&#x27;t require this mod. This is an optional tutorial for who wants to optimize their game, because it is slow.
:::</p><h3>1. Downloading Fabric</h3><p>First you have to <a href="https://fabricmc.net/use/">download</a> <strong>Fabric</strong> and install it.<br/>
Click on the &quot;<strong>Download installer</strong>&quot; button:</p><p><img src="imgs/1.png"/></p><h3>2. Edit the profile folder (optional step)</h3><p>Click on &quot;<strong>installations</strong>&quot;, then press on &quot;<strong>edit</strong>&quot; under the &quot;<strong>Fabric</strong>&quot; installation.</p><p><img src="imgs/3.png"/></p><p>Change the folder to a new one, for example I created a new profile folder called <code>Fabric</code> inside <code>.minecraft</code>.</p><p><img src="imgs/4.png"/></p><h3>3. Install the optimization mod</h3><p>Download the mod <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized/files/">here</a>.<br/></p><p>:::warning
Select your version and make sure to download the &quot;MultiMC&quot; type.
:::</p><p>Open the zip and extract the folders <code>mods</code> and <code>config</code> inside your <code>.minecraft</code> folder (or inside the <strong>Fabric</strong> profile folder).</p><h3>4. Run Fabric</h3>]]></content>
