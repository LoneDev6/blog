Setting up the Active Backup for Business app\\n\\nFirst of all you have to download it from the **Package Center**.<br />\\n\\n![](<imgs/1.png>)\\n\\nThen you can access it through the apps menu.\\n\\n![](<imgs/2.png>)\\n\\nNow add a new device, in this case your PC.\\n\\n![](<imgs/3.png>)\\n\\nCreate a backup task for the Windows disk selecting `System volume` as type.\\n\\n![](<imgs/4.png>)\\n\\nSchedule it to be ran at 3.20AM each Monday.\\n\\n![](<imgs/4_2.png>)\\n\\nCreate a backup task for your other disks selecting `Customized volume` as type.\\n\\n![](<imgs/5.png>)\\n\\nSchedule them/it to be ran at 3.20AM each Monday.\\n\\n![](<imgs/4_2.png>)\\n\\n### 2. Setting up the Active Backup for Business Agent on Windows\\n\\nYou also have to download the [Agent app for Windows](https://kb.synology.com/DSM/help/ActiveBackupBusinessAgent/activebackupbusinessagent), follow their installation tutorial.\\n\\n### 3. Scheduling automatic startup/shutdown of your Synology\\n\\nOpen the `Control panel`, then open `Hardware & Power`.<br />\\nNow create a new `Startup` task and set it to be executed at 3AM. We want to make sure the Synology NAS is turned on completely before backups.<br />\\nCreate a new `Shut Down` task and set it to be executed at 7AM. We want make sure all backups are finished and let the NAS do its own things if needed (optimizing the drive, deleting old backups etc).\\n\\n![](<imgs/6.png>)\\n\\n### 4. Scheduling automatic startup of your PC\\n\\nOpen the `Control panel`, then open `Task Scheduler`.<br />\\nNow create a new task and set it to be executed at 3.10AM, we want to make sure the Synology NAS is turned on completely before turning on our PC or it can\'t launch the command to turn on the PC.\\n\\n![](<imgs/7.png>)\\n![](<imgs/8.png>)\\n\\nNow set the `User-defined script` to this command which will send a packet to the PC to turn it on.<br />\\n`synonet --wake 00:00:00:00:00:00 eth0;`<br />\\nInstead of `00:00:00:00:00:00` you have to set your own PC mac address (search online how to get it).<br />\\nYou can also set a notification email to know when the PC was turned on to create a backup.<br />\\n\\n![](<imgs/9.png>)\\n\\n:::warning\\nMake sure to enable WakeOnLan on your motherboard, search online on how to do that (method changes on every PC).<br />\\n:::\\n\\n### 5. Scheduling automatic shutdown of your PC\\n\\nYou have to use my own program in order to schedule an automatic shutdown of your PC after every backup is finished since **Active Backup for Business** Agent lacks of this feature. <br />\\nDownload my program from my [Github repo](https://github.com/LoneDev6/ActiveBackupShutdown) and schedule an automated task to run it on Windows startup.\\n\\n### 6. Done!\\n\\nI know this tutorial may not be really for beginners but I\'d prefer to avoid spoonfeeding people.<br />\\nGood luck with your backups!"},{"id":"spam-emails-auto-removal","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/spam-emails-auto-removal","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-22-spam-emails-auto-removal/index.md","title":"Spam email auto-removal","description":"Spam emails","date":"2021-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 22, 2021","tags":[{"label":"email","permalink":"/blog/tags/email"},{"label":"gmail","permalink":"/blog/tags/gmail"},{"label":"spam","permalink":"/blog/tags/spam"},{"label":"scam","permalink":"/blog/tags/scam"},{"label":"js","permalink":"/blog/tags/js"},{"label":"coding","permalink":"/blog/tags/coding"},{"label":"web","permalink":"/blog/tags/web"}],"readingTime":2.11,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"LoneDev","title":"Owner of this blog","url":"https://github.com/lonedev6","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27242001","key":"lonedev"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Synology auto backup PC on night","permalink":"/blog/synology-auto-backup-pc"},"nextItem":{"title":"The future of ItemsAdder","permalink":"/blog/future-of-itemsadder"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## ![](icon.png) Spam emails\\n\\n![](<imgs/meme.png>)\\n\\nIf you hate seeing this little number on your Gmail Spam folder, then you will find this article useful.\\n\\n![](<imgs/1.png>)\\n\\nSometimes you may receive important emails and they end up being flagged as spam by Gmail, so you probably check this folder daily to make sure no email got mistakely flagged, but you end up seeing:\\n- meet single Russians\\n- click here to get 1000$\\n- your package is going to be delivered, you have to pay the shipping\\n- and so on...\\n\\n## Google Script\\n\\n1.

It\'s a plugin for [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) servers which allows admins to extend the game without modding the client.\\n\\n## First days\\n\\nThe plugin was published initially on 2016 and was called **NewItems**, it was one of my very first Java projects and I was a newbie on Spigot development.<br />\\nI abandoned the old project after a year or so due to personal life, but then I picked it back up and started working on the very new version which ended up begin renamed ItemsAdder. As you know this version has more features, has a totally different structure and allows to achieve extreme customization of the game.\\n\\n## Current days\\n\\nI didn\'t expect this much fame for that single product, the [max peak](https://pstats.devs.beer/plugin/bukkit/ItemsAdder/6) of servers which use ItemsAdder amounts to **1097 max online servers** and **3800 max players** enjoying the plugin.<br />\\nItemsAdder is in the [top 3](https://i.imgur.com/m3edZ8T.png) of the best voted paid Spigot plugins to this date, which is unbelievable, a plugin published in 2019 managed to reach the top 3 in 2 years while the forum itself is online since 2012.\\n\\nCurrently my main efforts are to maintain the most stable and optimized code as possible because this plugin is used on servers with more than 100 players connected, performance is a priority in these cases.\\n\\nThe most difficult task is to give support to customers because a lot of them find it easier to contact me without reading the official tutorials nor asking to the other community members and this sadly cuts a lot of the development time.\\nI\'d love to spend more time on actually coding the plugin.<br />\\nSadly most of them blackmail me with 1 star reviews which is making this situation really hard to maintain in the long term. \\n\\n## The future\\n\\nBack in the day I rushed a lot of ItemsAdder features initial planning, this resulted in non-balanced default stats and gameplay, this is why I\'m currently working with some friends to rebalance the default items pack and provide a better gameplay.<br />\\nThis is a very long task due to the fact that this plugin offers more than 500 default items/materials/blocks but I\'ll do my best to release an updated pack before mid 2022.<br />\\nI also plan to hook into the Minecraft gameplay itself and fix all the unbalanced features of the vanilla gameplay. Sadly this game has a lot of flaws which allow users to [speedrun it in no time](https://www.speedrun.com/mc/run/zq13899m).\\n\\nOne of the last important tasks I have scheduled is to find a proper way to avoid spamming customers which are contacting me everyday to ask basic questions. Right now I have no solution as this is the problem every developer has with this community."},{"id":"optimize-minecraft","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/optimize-minecraft","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-14-optimize-minecraft/index.md","title":"\u26a1 Optimize Minecraft client","description":"Minecraft is slow","date":"2021-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 14, 2021","tags":[{"label":"spigot","permalink":"/blog/tags/spigot"},{"label":"minecraft","permalink":"/blog/tags/minecraft"},{"label":"fabric","permalink":"/blog/tags/fabric"}],"readingTime":0.77,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"LoneDev","title":"Owner of this blog","url":"https://github.com/lonedev6","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27242001","key":"lonedev"}],"prevItem":{"title":"The future of ItemsAdder","permalink":"/blog/future-of-itemsadder"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n## Minecraft is slow\\n\\n\\n:::info\\n**Minecraft** is known to be very heavy, the community had fixed most of its problems.<br />\\nMy plugins don\'t require this mod.
